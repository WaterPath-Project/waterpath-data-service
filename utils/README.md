# Utilities for Verifying NetCDF Clipping and Year Selection

This folder contains diagnostic scripts to verify that population projection data is being processed correctly.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have poetry installed and dependencies set up:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\user\source\waterpath-data-service
poetry install
```

## Available Tools

### 1. Inspect NetCDF Structure (`inspect_netcdf.py`)

View the internal structure of the population NetCDF files, including subdatasets and band→year mapping.

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Inspect SSP1 NetCDF
poetry run python utils/inspect_netcdf.py --ssp SSP1

# Inspect SSP2 NetCDF
poetry run python utils/inspect_netcdf.py --ssp SSP2
```

**Output:**
- File path and size
- CRS information
- List of subdatasets with dimensions
- Band index → Year mapping (showing band 1 = 2006, band 25 = 2030, etc.)

---

### 2. Verify Clipping (`verify_clip.py`)

Check that the clipped `isoraster.tif` matches the session shapefile boundaries.

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Basic verification (text output only)
poetry run python utils/verify_clip.py <session_id>

# Verify specific scenario
poetry run python utils/verify_clip.py test_7 --scenario SSP1_2030

# With visualization (opens a plot window)
poetry run python utils/verify_clip.py kampala_dataset --visualize
```

**Output:**
- Shapefile CRS and bounds
- Clipped raster CRS, bounds, and shape
- Data statistics (min/max/mean, valid pixel count)
- CRS alignment check (✓ or ⚠)
- Bounds comparison to verify clipping didn't cut off data
- Optional: Visual overlay of raster and shapefile boundary

---

### 3. Extract Year Sample (`extract_year_sample.py`)

Pull a small data sample from a specific year in the NetCDF to verify the correct band is being used.

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Extract sample from SSP1, year 2030
poetry run python utils/extract_year_sample.py --ssp SSP1 --year 2030

# Extract larger sample (10x10 pixels instead of 5x5)
poetry run python utils/extract_year_sample.py --ssp SSP2 --year 2050 --sample-size 10
```

**Output:**
- Band index calculation (e.g., year 2030 → band 25)
- Which subdataset is being read
- Sample data values from the center of the grid
- Statistics (min/max/mean)

---

## Example Workflow

### Verify a projection was generated correctly:

1. **Check the NetCDF structure:**
   ```powershell
   poetry run python utils/inspect_netcdf.py --ssp SSP1
   ```
   Confirm that band 25 corresponds to year 2030, etc.

2. **Verify the year extraction:**
   ```powershell
   poetry run python utils/extract_year_sample.py --ssp SSP1 --year 2030
   ```
   Check that the sample data looks reasonable (non-zero population values).

3. **Verify the clipping:**
   ```powershell
   poetry run python utils/verify_clip.py test_7 --scenario SSP1_2030 --visualize
   ```
   Confirm:
   - CRS matches between shapefile and raster ✓
   - Raster bounds are within shapefile bounds ✓
   - Visual overlay shows the clipped region aligns with shapefile
   - Valid pixel percentage is reasonable (not 100% nodata)

## Troubleshooting

### "No isoraster.tif files found"
- Make sure you've called the `/api/projections/generate` endpoint with `schema=population`
- Check that the scenario folder was created under `data/<session_id>/scenarios/<SSP>_<year>/`

### "CRS mismatch"
- This is usually OK if the code reprojects automatically
- The verify script will show both CRS values
- Use `--visualize` to confirm the overlay looks correct

### Visualization doesn't work
- You need matplotlib with a GUI backend (TkAgg, Qt5Agg)
- Try running without `--visualize` for text-only output
- On headless servers, skip visualization or export to image file

---

## Integration with API

These tools work with the data generated by:

```
POST /api/projections/generate?session_id=<id>&schema=population&ssp=SSP1&year=2030
```

Which produces:
```
data/<session_id>/scenarios/SSP1_2030/
  ├── isoraster.tif          ← Clipped population raster
  └── human_emissions.csv    ← Merged baseline emissions
```
